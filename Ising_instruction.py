The initialization of lattice should be the first step of simulation. In this function,

Flip a spin, namely change the state of one lattice point from +1 to -1 or from -1 to +1, 
once a time to generate a new state of lattice.

If the old state of lattice and a new state of lattice are given, use Metropolis Algorithm to determine whether
we should accept it or not.
